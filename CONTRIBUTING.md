# Contributing to RNN Trade Forecast

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DeepAR_trade_forecast
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   # or
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v --cov=deepar_forecast
   ```

## Code Style

- Use `black` for code formatting: `black src/ tests/`
- Use `ruff` for linting: `ruff check src/ tests/`
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test critical paths:
  - Data leakage prevention
  - Model regression loss computation
  - Backtest cost calculations

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make your changes with clear, atomic commits
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Run tests and linting
6. Submit PR with clear description
